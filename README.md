# English Style Guide

This is an English style guide that we should follow to stay consistent in how we refer to common things in tutorials.

In general, we follow the [AP style guide](https://www.apstylebook.com/) and the [Apple Style Guide](http://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/). This guide has some tweaks and clarifications on top of those. The guide also covers terms used within Unity tutorials. Finally, we use US English spellings in our tutorials.

## iOS Terms and Capitalization

_Capitalize and style terms as below._

**app**
Use _app_ instead of _application_, unless _application_ is more clear or refers to a non-iOS entity.

**app delegate**

**app group**

**Auto Layout**

**base 10**
...or base 2 or base 16 or base 8 when “binary”, “hexadecimal” or “octal” won't do. No hyphenation.

**Bézier curves**

**Boolean**
In honor of George Boole. :]

**button**
Use lowercase, including when instructing the reader to drag one into the scene.

**build and run**
Use lowercase and do not bold.

**CocoaPod**

**Cocos2d**
Whether and how to capitalize this (_cocos2d? Cocos2D?_) has been notoriously difficult to pin down, but currently, _Cocos2d_ seems to be the most common form.

**Control-click**

**Control-drag**

**document outline**
Apple tends to use the term _outline view_ in its documentation, so that is OK as well; however, use one or the other for consistency.

**double-click**

**drop-down**

**editors**
Use lowercase; e.g. _assistant editor_, _standard editor_, _scene editor_.

**frame rate**
_FPS_ not _fps_

**Git**
Unless you're specifically referring to a command using the tool, Git should be a proper noun. When used as a command, make sure to mark it as code: `git`.

**GitHub**

**glance**
Use lowercase, including when instructing the reader to drag one into the scene.

**Gmail**

**group**

**image view**

**In-App Purchase**
When referring to the feature or API. As a singular instance, simply in-app purchase.

**information**
Please, not "info". 

**inspectors**
Capitalize when it's a button name or in a menu command. Otherwise, spell with a lowercase _i_. When referring to panes in Xcode, capitalize the name of the pane but not "inspector"; e.g., _Attributes inspector_, _File inspector_, _Size inspector_.

**Interface Builder**

**interface controller**
Use lowercase, even when referring a specific, named instance such as _the_ `GroceryList` _interface controller._

**iOS 7, iOS 8**
Not _iOS7_ or _iOS8_.

**iPhone 4s, 5s, 5c, 6c**
Not _iPhone 4S, 5S, etc._ This is as per Apple.

**JavaScriptCore**

**key-value pair**
Not "key/value pair".

**keyboard keys**
Spell out and capitalize, whether alone or in multi-press combinations: _Shift-Command-Option-X_.

You _press_ keys, you don't _type_ or _hit_ them.

**label**
Use lowercase, including when instructing the reader to drag one into the scene.

**macOS**

**menu**

**minigame**

**navigators**
Capitalize when it's a button name or in a menu command. Otherwise, spell with a lowercase _n_. When referring to panes in Xcode, capitalize the name of the pane but not "navigator"; e.g., _Project navigator_, _Issue navigator_, _Test navigator_.

**Notification Center**
But a specific instance is usually termed "the user notification center" in lowercase.

**Object Library**

**Objective-C**, not Objective C or Obj-C.

**OK**
Don't use _okay_ or _Ok_.

**offscreen**

**onscreen**

**open-source**

**OS X**
Don't use _OS X_ or _OSX_; it's now macOS.

**playground**

**Podfile**

**pop-up**

**project navigator**

**Retina and non-Retina**

**right-click**

**results sidebar**
Area to the right-hand side of a playground showing the return value of a statement

**setup, set up, set-up**

"Set up" is the verb, where you _set up_ your computer.
"Setup" is the noun. The Catterwauls have quite a _setup_ in their video studio.

Take care of those first two forms properly and you’ve covered 95% of cases.

"Set-up" is a common adjectival noun: My mobile carrier has a steep _set-up_ fee. But I wouldn’t slap anyone with a trout for using the above noun form instead: a steep _setup_ fee

**simulator**
_iOS Simulator_ is a simulator app. Generally speaking, use lowercase _simulator_ unless you omit the article:

_Correct:_ run in the simulator  
_Correct:_ run in iOS Simulator _(note lack of article)_  
_Incorrect_: run in the Simulator

It's OK to both use an article and capitalize _Simulator_ if you are using it as an attributive noun:

_Correct:_ close the Simulator window

**size classes**

**storyboard**

**superclass**

**terminal**
OS X includes a terminal emulator program called _Terminal_. Generally speaking, use lowercase _terminal_ unless you omit the article:

_Correct:_ close the terminal  
_Correct:_ open a terminal window  
_Correct:_ use the terminal command  
_Correct:_ enter the following command into Terminal _(note lack of article)_  
_Correct:_ open Terminal _(note lack of article)_  
_Incorrect:_ open the Terminal

It's OK to both use an article and capitalize _Terminal_ if you are using it as an attributive noun: 

_Correct:_ open a Terminal window  
_Correct:_ use the Terminal command  
_Correct:_ open the Terminal application

**Today**
As in Today extension, Today view, etc.

**top shelf**
No definite consensus on this one from Apple (Top Shelf is used as well); the top area of the tvOS Home Screen.

**Touch ID**

**view controller**

**Watch app**
Not _watch app_ or _Watch App_.

**Xcode**

## Other Style Guidelines

**Apple**
Use the pronoun *it* to refer to Apple and any other company or organization; do not use *they*.

_Example:_ Apple has its own solution...

**bolding**
Use the bold style (&lt;em&gt; in WordPress) for things the reader needs to click, modify, enter into a text field or otherwise notice. This includes file and directory names, but only those that are the action item of a nearby instruction.

When instructing the reader to makes changes, bold each object in the process, with the exception of UI elements.

_Example:_ In the hierarchy, select the **SpaceShip** and from the inspector, inside the **Alien Component**, set the **IsDead** property to **false**.

Also use the bold style to highlight important concepts that are being introduced for the first time.

For bolding in lists, see **lists**.

**book references**
References to other books should be italicized: 

_Example:_ If you’re new to iOS development, we recommend you start with _iOS Apprentice_.

**chapter references**
When referring to chapters in the same book, give the chapter number and place the chapter title in quotes: 

_Example:_ Chapter 15, “Performance Tips and Tricks”

References to chapters in other books can be written as follows:

_Example:_ Check out the “Doing Cool Stuff” chapter of _Ray’s Awesome Book_.

**coordinates**
_(x, y)_ not _(x,y)_

Note that _coordinate_ refers to one of the group (_the x-coordinate_), while _coordinates_ refers to more than one and usually the entire group (_the GPS coordinates of Cupertino_).

**emoticons**
These are not punctuation; sentences that end with an emoticon still need appropriate punctuation that should fall before the emoticon rather than after it.

**file extensions**
either _XXX_ or _.xxx_

**game references**
Italicize the names of published games, like _Super Mario Bros._ or _Angry Birds_, but not the names of other software.

**headers**

* _Casing in tutorials:_ Capitalize headers, leaving any article, preposition or coordinating conjunction that is three letters or less lowercase, unless it is the first word in the heading. For example, it is important to capitalize the verb _Go_ but _not_ the word _to_ in **Where to Go From Here?**</li>

* _Casing in books:_ Use sentence casing by capitalizing only the first letter of the first word, except for proper nouns.</li>

* _Placement:_ Insert when the subject moves from one point to another; more is usually better than less. Also ensure that if H2 and H3 headers are used they are nested appropriately. For example, there is no point in having a single H2 and then seventeen H3 headings for the rest of the article.</li>

**inline code**
Use the inline code style (&lt;code&gt; in WordPress) for all class, function and method names. Remember to use it for these words:
`nil`  
`if` statement  
`while` loop  
`if-else`  
`Int`  
`enum`  
`switch` statement

**lists**
List items should be followed by colons, not dashes.

If a list includes items, bold them (&lt;em&gt; in WordPress). If the list items are code structures, use the bold style rather than the inline code style.

**numbers vs. numerals**
Spell out whole numbers up to and including nine, as well as larger numbers that can be expressed in one or two words.

_Examples:_ zero, one, nine, six million.

Use numerals for numbers greater than nine; for decimals and percentages; for numbers that express mathematical figures; for addresses, dates, the time of day, and page or chapter numbers; and when a numeral is important for identification purposes.

_Examples:_ 10; 25,000; 30%; divide 15 by 3; Chapter 6; Highway 4; Room 2.

Numbers in series should be consistent.

_Example:_ She went to five countries on four continents in sixteen days _OR_ She went to 5 countries on 4 continents in 16 days.  
_Example:_ The final score was 13-1 _OR_ The final score was thirteen to one.

_Note:_ There are a lot of exceptions to these basic rules, so use your best judgment.

**quotation marks**
Punctuation not essential to a quote should be placed outside of the quotes (British style) so as to avoid any possible confusion about whether a punctuation mark is part of a string or any other bit of code.

**screen gestures**
You _tap_ something on a screen, you don't _click_, _touch_ or _press_ it; the only exception to this is a _long press_ on an object on the phone's screen.

**URL**
Write URLs in lowercase, and leave off the leading www if possible: raywenderlich.com. No special formatting required when the website is part of the main body text.

## Unity Terms and Capitalization

_Capitalize and style terms as below:_

Animator window  
  
animation  

Animation view  
  
camera (when talking about the GameObject or when talking about cameras in general)  
  
Camera (when talking about the Camera component)

component  

coroutine 

Game view  

GameObject  

gizmo

Hierarchy window

Inspector window

Mecanim  
  
MonoBehaviour
  
object

prefab

Project window

scene

Scene view  
  
script

sprite

Transform  

toolbar  

UI 

Unity editor


## Other Unity Style Guidelines

**animated GIFs** Use animated GIFs only once for an operation. When repeating the operation, use either a screenshot or refer the reader back to the animated GIF.

**project assets** All assets in a project should be named using UpperCamelCase.

**spoilers** Use spoilers to "quiz" readers on repeated operations in the tutorial.

**script vs component** When talking about the actual .cs file (and the MonoBehaviour class that's inside) call it a **script**, when you're in the editor and you take that **script** and attach it to a GameObject, refer to it as a **component** ("instance" of a script).  
  
**camera vs Camera** Some common terms like camera, light, collider also have components that are named the same. This can get confusing sometimes. Therefore, when referring to a **common GameObject** (e.g. the **camera**) use lowercase, when referring specifically to the  attached **component** use UpperCamelCase.

**Vector representations** If you describe a **Vector2**, **Vector3** or similar data, use this notation: **(X:1, Y:2, Z:3)**

## Apple Watch Style Guidelines

**complications**

**Digital Crown**
"the Digital Crown" when referring to the hardware component, but "Digital Crown" when referring to the API.

**Dock**
Also "the Dock"

**Home screen**
Also "the Home screen"

**Time Travel**

**WatchKit**

## Serial (Oxford) Commas

In general, digital copy looks best when the serial comma is NOT used. This is the general direction followed by several (but not all!) modern style manuals.

An example of the serial comma in use: "Ray wrote three posts, two product reviews, and a scathing exposé on Android."

The preferred practice is to remove the final comma in the list of elements (the one usually before the 'and', 'or' or 'nor' ): "Ray wrote three posts, two product reviews and a scathing exposé on Android."

However, retain the extra comma when necessary to avoid ambiguity: "Ray loves his employees, Tim Cook and Steve Ballmer." Well, we're pretty sure Tim Cook and Steve Ballmer don't work for Ray (just yet), so leave the comma in to be clear: "Ray loves his employees, Tim Cook, and Steve Ballmer."

But beware - the presence of AND following a comma does not imply a serial comma is in use: "Ray continues to throw fits when he sees a serial comma in use, and it's really nervewracking for editors to see their fearless leader in such a despondent state." Here you have two independent clauses that could be written as two separate sentences without losing meaning: "Ray continues to throw fits when he sees a serial comma in use. It's really nervewracking for editors to see their fearless leader in such a despondent state." However, the two share a common idea or thread and you can join them with a comma and a conjunction as I did above.
